## 🏗️ Architecture

### Two-Phase AI Processing

#### Phase 1: Knowledge Graph Construction

- Extracts metadata from uploaded materials
- Builds comprehensive knowledge graph (25-50 nodes)
- Generates clinical pearls and ELI5 analogies
- Performs Google Search verification for gap-filling

#### Phase 2: Content Generation

- Streams 4,000-8,000 word markdown study guides
- Integrates 25-35 authoritative citations
- Auto-links clinical terms to knowledge graph nodes
